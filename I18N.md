## Internationalization

Lenster uses LinguiJS and Crowdin for internationalization.

## Extracting strings from source code to .po files

    yarn extract

## Automatic sync with Crowdin via Github

Two Github workflows are used to sync translations with Crowdin.

[Crowdin upload](https://github.com/lensterxyz/lenster/blob/main/.github/workflows/crowdin-upload.yml) is configured to upload any new strings to Crowdin when `main` branch is updated.

[Crowdin download](https://github.com/lensterxyz/lenster/blob/main/.github/workflows/crowdin-download.yml) is configured to download translations from Crowdin and create a pull request. The workflow is scheduled to run nightly.

The workflows provide environment variables from Github secrets to `crowdin.yml`. Both workflows can be run manually from Actions tab in Lenster repository on Github.

## Syncing with Crowdin project via command line

When syncing from command line, environment variables `CROWDIN_PROJECT_ID` and `CROWDIN_PERSONAL_TOKEN`, which are used in `crowdin.yml`, need to be set.

Uploading sources (English .po file) to Crowdin

    yarn crowdin push

Downloading translations from Crowdin

    yarn crowdin pull
