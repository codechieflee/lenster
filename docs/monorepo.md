# Monorepo

## Introduction

A monorepo is a single repository that contains multiple projects. This is useful for projects that have multiple packages that are closely related and need to be released together. For example, a project that has a web app and a server app might have a monorepo that contains both apps.

## Structure

The monorepo is structured as follows:

- `apps/` - Contains the apps.
- `packages/` - Contains the packages.
- `docs/` - Contains the documentation.
- `scripts/` - Contains the scripts.
